Title: On proximal mappings with Young functions in uniformly convex Banach spaces
Authors: Miroslav Bacak , Ulrich Kohlenbach
(Submitted on 14 Sep 2017 ( v1 ), last revised 4 Nov 2017 (this version, v3))

    Abstract: It is well known in convex analysis that proximal mappings on Hilbert spaces are 1 -Lipschitz. In the present paper we show that proximal mappings on uniformly convex Banach spaces are uniformly continuous on bounded sets. Moreover, we introduce a new general proximal mapping whose regularization term is given as a composition of a Young function and the norm, and formulate our results at this level of generality. It is our aim to obtain the corresponding modulus of uniform continuity explicitly in terms of a modulus of uniform convexity of the norm and of moduli witnessing properties of the Young function. We also derive several quantitative results on uniform convexity, which may be of interest on their own.
