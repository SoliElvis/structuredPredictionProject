Title: Primal-dual extragradient methods for nonlinear nonsmooth PDE-constrained optimization
Authors: Christian Clason , Tuomo Valkonen
(Submitted on 20 Jun 2016 ( v1 ), last revised 15 Mar 2017 (this version, v3))

    Abstract: We study the extension of the Chambolle--Pock primal-dual algorithm to nonsmooth optimization problems involving nonlinear operators between function spaces. Local convergence is shown under technical conditions including metric regularity of the corresponding primal-dual optimality conditions. We also show convergence for a Nesterov-type accelerated variant provided one part of the functional is strongly convex.
    We show the applicability of the accelerated algorithm to examples of inverse problems with L 1 - and L ∞ -fitting terms as well as of state-constrained optimal control problems, where convergence can be guaranteed after introducing an (arbitrary small, still nonsmooth) Moreau--Yosida regularization. This is verified in numerical examples.
