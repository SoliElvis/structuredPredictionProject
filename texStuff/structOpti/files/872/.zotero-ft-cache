Course information

Description. The course continues ECE236B and covers several advanced and current topics in optimization, with an emphasis on large-scale algorithms for convex optimization. This includes first-order methods for large-scale optimization (gradient and subgradient method, conjugate gradient method, proximal gradient method, accelerated gradient methods), decomposition and splitting methods (dual decomposition, augmented Lagrangian method, alternating direction method of multipliers, monotone operators and operator splitting), and (possibly) interior-point algorithms for conic optimization.

Lecture notes. The lecture notes will be posted on this website. Many of the topics are covered in the following books and in the course EE364b (Convex Optimization II) at Stanford University.
