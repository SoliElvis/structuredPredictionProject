Title: A Primal-Dual Algorithm for General Convex-Concave Saddle Point Problems
Authors: Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani , Necdet Serhat Aybat

    Abstract: In this paper we propose a primal-dual algorithm with a novel momentum term using the partial gradients of the coupling function that can be viewed as a generalization of the method proposed by Chambolle and Pock in 2016 to solve saddle point problems defined by a convex-concave function L ( x , y ) = f ( x ) + Φ ( x , y ) − h ( y ) with a general coupling term Φ ( x , y ) that is \emph{not} assumed to be bilinear. Given a saddle point ( x ∗ , y ∗ ) , assuming ∇ x Φ ( ⋅ , y ) is Lipschitz in x for any fixed y , and ∇ y Φ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) is Lipschitz, we derive error bounds in terms of L ( x ¯ k , y ∗ ) − L ( x ∗ , y ¯ k ) for the ergodic sequence { x ¯ k , y ¯ k } ; in particular, we show O ( 1 / k ) rate when the problem is merely convex in x . Furthermore, assuming Φ ( x , ⋅ ) is linear in y for each fixed x and f is strongly convex, we obtain the ergodic convergence rate of O ( 1 / k 2 ) -- we are not aware of another single-loop method in the related literature achieving the same rate when Φ is not bilinear. We tested our method for solving kernel matrix learning problem, and compare it against the Mirror-prox algorithm and interior point methods.
